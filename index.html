              For the last 20 years Nick Smallman, has been showing people all
              over the world how to develop their Charisma, Gravitas and

            <h6 id="artcalpara1">A different coaching method</h6>
           <p class="detailpara"> A lot of executive coaching fails because the client is told what to
            do and to replace their current methods and technique.
            Unfortunately, human beings are creatures of habit and insecurity.
            Usually, we all revert to old behaviours, so the new way gets lost.

            <p class="detailpara">
              Nick will show you how to become an extraordinary speaker and
              communicator by using a series of psychological techniques that
              once employed and embedded, strengthen your ability over time.
              Good coaching is about changing your mind on a fundamental level
              rather than showing you what to do. Real growth is psychological.
              The physical will follow. He will teach you techniques not by
              telling you what to do but instead by giving you solutions that
              embed themselves in your thinking. Over time, many of the things
              you thought were beyond possibility become easy and natural
